# as_utils

Utilities we use at DU to work with ArchivesSpace content. Mostly these are written in Perl and should be run from command line.

What's here:

* as_utils.pl: These are sub-routines that get used in other Perl scripts
* marc.pl: Script to batch export collection-level MARC records and modify them according to our local cataloging guidelines
